# String Primitives and Macros

This program utilizes two macros, invoked by various procedures, that read and display strings.  The program prompts ten integers from the user, reads the numbers as strings (ASCII), converts them to numeric values, saves them in an array, and calculates the sum and truncated average of the numbers.  It then converts the integers (numeric) back to the ASCII representation of the numbers and displays the list of entered numbers and the results of the calculations.
